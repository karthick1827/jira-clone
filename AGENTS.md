# ACL-ADLC

Open source framework for structured, agent-assisted software delivery.

## Rules

- Use Conventional Commits for every commit.
- Before pushing, run `npm ci && npm run quality` on `HEAD` in the exact checkout you are about to push.
  `quality` mirrors the checks in `.github/workflows/quality.yaml`.

- Skill validation rules are in `tools/skill-validator.md`.
- Deterministic skill checks run via `npm run validate:skills` (included in `quality`).

## 🚦 Phase Gate Approval Invariants (Mandatory & Non-Negotiable)

- **Universal Sequential Document Gate for ALL Agents & Skills**:
  - EVERY single agent (Sally UX Designer, Winston Architect, Amelia Developer, Mary Analyst, etc.) and EVERY skill (`acl-architecture`, `acl-ux`, `acl-create-epics-and-stories`, `acl-quick-dev`, `acl-figma-bridge`, etc.) across ALL AI tools (Cursor, Antigravity, AGY, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Windsurf, Roo Code, etc.) MUST FIRST verify that all applicable upstream phase deliverables in `_acl-output/` have `status: Approved`.
  - **Prerequisite Deliverables Scope (What Requires Approval)**:
    - Phase 1: `_acl-output/1-analysis/acl-product-brief/brief.md`
    - Phase 2: `_acl-output/2-plan-workflows/acl-prd/prd.md`
    - Phase 3A: `_acl-output/3-solutioning/acl-architecture/architecture-spine.md` (or `architecture.md`)
    - Phase 3B: `_acl-output/3-solutioning/acl-create-epics-and-stories/epics.md`
    - Phase 4: `_acl-output/4-implementation/story-<epic_num>-<story_num>.md` (Tier 2) or `_acl-output/4-implementation/spec-<feature-slug>.md` (Tier 1)
  - **STRICT EXCLUSIONS (Internal Working Files NEVER Require Approval)**:
    - Internal working memory logs (`.memlog.md`, `*-memlog.md`), supplementary child files (`addendum.md`, `sources.md`, `research.md`, `review-triage.md`, `patch-plan.md`, `test-summary.md`), and test directories are internal AI working artifacts.
    - AI agents MUST NEVER evaluate internal memory logs or child files for approval status, and MUST NEVER block gates based on them. Gate evaluation applies STRICTLY to the primary deliverables listed above.
  - If **ANY** required upstream phase deliverable listed above is missing, or has ANY status other than `Approved` (e.g. `In Review`, `draft`, `Pending`, `Rejected`):
    - **TOTAL AGENT BLOCK (NO PERSONAS, NO CHATTING, NO BRAINSTORMING, NO FILE GENERATION)**:
      - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from adopting personas or greeting the user as an agent.
      - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from offering conversational advice, whiteboard diagrams, or brainstorming in chat while waiting for approval.
      - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from creating, updating, or modifying downstream files.
      - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from asking or suggesting the user/developer to self-approve or change the status.
    - **THE ONLY PERMITTED ACTION**: The AI Agent MUST inform the user to WAIT for Manager sign-off:

      ```text
      ========================================================================
      ⏳ [GATE LOCKED]: Awaiting Manager Sign-Off (ACL-ADLC Protocol)
      ========================================================================
      📄 Document in Review: <Document Name> (<Path>)
      🏷️ Current Status:      [IN REVIEW / PENDING]

      ⚠️ STATUS:
         As per the ACL-ADLC sequential delivery framework, this document
         is currently awaiting official review and sign-off by your Manager.

      👉 NEXT STEP:
         Please wait for your manager to review and mark this document as
         'Approved' or 'Rejected' in Markdown Studio before proceeding with
         downstream tasks (<Next Phase / Skill Name>).
      ========================================================================
      ```

### 1. Brownfield Change Request Protocol (Interactive Tier Selection)

Whenever the developer asks for a feature, bugfix, or code change in a Brownfield project:

#### Case A: Tier is Explicitly Specified in the User Prompt

If the user specifies a tier (e.g., _"Tier 1: create notification drawer"_, _"Tier 2: migrate database"_, or _"use Tier 1"_), the AI Agent immediately follows the rules of that tier without asking.

#### Case B: No Tier is Specified in the User Prompt

The AI Agent **MUST NOT** immediately write code or modify files.  
The AI Agent **MUST FIRST** output the following interactive prompt and **STOP** to await the user's choice:

```text
========================================================================
📊 [BROWNFIELD ASSESSMENT]: Choose Execution Tier
========================================================================
🎯 Feature / Change:   <Summary of requested work>
💡 AI Recommendation:  [Tier 1 / Tier 2 based on blast radius]

Please choose which Tier you want to proceed with:

  [1] Tier 1 — Self-Contained Spec (1-Page Story + Manager Sign-Off)
      📝 AI generates a 1-page Spec in _acl-output/4-implementation/ (status: In Review).
      ⏳ Code implementation is strictly LOCKED until Manager approves in Markdown Studio.

  [2] Tier 2 — Major Architectural Overhaul
      🏛️ Full sequential governance (Product Brief -> PRD -> Architecture Spine -> Epics).

👉 Reply with 1 or 2 to proceed:
========================================================================
```

---

### 2. Blast-Radius Tier Rules (2 Tiers: Tier 1 & Tier 2)

> ⚠️ **GOVERNANCE POLICY**: Every change, bugfix, or feature in a Brownfield project requires at minimum a 1-Page Spec with Manager Sign-Off in Markdown Studio (**Tier 1**), or full sequential governance for major architectural overhauls (**Tier 2**). Direct unverified code generation without an approved spec is strictly forbidden.

#### 🟡 Tier 1: Self-Contained Features & Tweaks (1-Page Spec + Manager Approval Gate)

- **Scope**: All standard features, standalone dialogs, modals, widgets, UI tweaks, bug fixes, or components.
- **Workflow**:
  1. **Spec Generation**: The AI Agent creates a concise 1-page specification in `_acl-output/4-implementation/spec-<feature-slug>.md` with frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     ---
     title: <Feature Name>
     tier: Tier 1 (Self-Contained)
     status: In Review
     type: feature
     created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
     ---
     ```
  2. **Immediate Gate Lock**:
     - The AI Agent **MUST IMMEDIATELY HALT**.
     - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from generating or modifying any application code.
     - The AI Agent **MUST** output the Gate Lock banner:

       ```text
       ========================================================================
       ⏳ [GATE LOCKED]: Awaiting Manager Sign-Off (ACL-ADLC Protocol)
       ========================================================================
       📄 Document in Review: spec-<feature-slug>.md (_acl-output/4-implementation/)
       🏷️ Current Status:      [IN REVIEW]

       ⚠️ STATUS:
          As per the Brownfield Tier 1 protocol, this 1-page specification
          is currently awaiting official review and sign-off by your Manager.
          Code implementation is strictly locked until approved.

       👉 NEXT STEP:
          Please open Markdown Studio (http://localhost:5173/markdown.html)
          and have your Manager review and mark this document as 'Approved'
          or 'Rejected' before proceeding with code implementation.
       ========================================================================
       ```

  3. **Verification Before Coding**:
     - When the developer later asks to implement the code, the AI Agent **MUST check the status** of `spec-<feature-slug>.md`.
     - If `status: Approved`: The AI Agent is **UNBLOCKED** and proceeds to implement the code.
     - If `status: In Review`, `status: Rejected`, or missing: The AI Agent **REMAINS BLOCKED** and refuses to write code.

#### 🔴 Tier 2: Major Architectural Overhauls

- **Scope**: Complete framework upgrades, database schema rewrites, replacing global state/auth paradigms, or major cross-cutting capabilities.
- **Sequential Pipeline**:
  1. **Phase 1 (Product Brief)**: The AI Agent **FIRST** creates `_acl-output/1-analysis/acl-product-brief/brief.md` with frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     ---
     title: 'Product Brief: <Feature/Overhaul Name>'
     project_type: brownfield
     tier: Tier 2 (Major Overhaul)
     status: In Review
     created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
     ---
     ```
     **Immediate Gate Lock**: The AI Agent **MUST IMMEDIATELY HALT** and output the Gate Lock banner for `brief.md`. Downstream deliverables (PRD, Architecture Spine, Epics) and application code are strictly locked until `brief.md` is approved by the Manager in Markdown Studio.
  2. **Phase 2 (PRD)**: Once `brief.md` has `status: Approved`, the AI creates `_acl-output/2-plan-workflows/acl-prd/prd.md` (`status: In Review`) and halts for approval.
  3. **Phase 3A (Architecture Spine)**: Once PRD has `status: Approved`, the AI creates `_acl-output/3-solutioning/acl-architecture/architecture-spine.md` (`status: In Review`) and halts for approval.
  4. **Phase 3B (Epics & Stories)**: Once Architecture has `status: Approved`, the AI creates `_acl-output/3-solutioning/acl-create-epics-and-stories/epics.md` (`status: In Review`) and halts for approval.
  5. **Phase 4 (Story-Level Implementation & Mandatory Manager Sign-Off Gate)**:
     - Implementation proceeds **one story at a time** as defined in `epics.md`.
     - **Story Spec Generation**: Before writing or modifying any application code for a story (e.g. Story 1.1), the AI Agent **MUST FIRST** create the story implementation specification in `_acl-output/4-implementation/story-<epic_num>-<story_num>.md` (e.g. `story-1-1.md`) containing:
       - Frontmatter with `status: In Review`, `tier: Tier 2`, `story_id: <epic_num>.<story_num>`, `title: <Story Title>`.
       - The story's detailed description, technical contract, and explicit acceptance criteria checklist (`- [ ] <criterion>`).
     - **Immediate Gate Lock**:
       - The AI Agent **MUST IMMEDIATELY HALT**.
       - The AI Agent is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from generating or modifying application code for this story.
       - The AI Agent **MUST** output the Gate Lock banner:

         ```text
         ========================================================================
         ⏳ [GATE LOCKED]: Awaiting Manager Sign-Off (ACL-ADLC Protocol)
         ========================================================================
         📄 Document in Review: story-<epic_num>-<story_num>.md (_acl-output/4-implementation/)
         🏷️ Current Status:      [IN REVIEW]

         ⚠️ STATUS:
            As per the Brownfield Tier 2 protocol, implementation of Story <epic_num>.<story_num>
            is currently awaiting official review and sign-off by your Manager.
            Code implementation for this story is strictly locked until approved.

         👉 NEXT STEP:
            Please open Markdown Studio (http://localhost:5173/markdown.html)
            and have your Manager review and mark this story specification as 'Approved'
            or 'Rejected' before proceeding with code implementation.
         ========================================================================
         ```

     - **Verification Before Story Coding**:
       - The AI Agent checks the status of `_acl-output/4-implementation/story-<epic_num>-<story_num>.md`.
       - If `status: Approved`: The AI Agent is **UNBLOCKED** to implement the application code for this story.
       - If `status: In Review`, `status: Rejected`, or missing: The AI Agent **REMAINS BLOCKED** and refuses to write code.
     - **Acceptance Criteria Telemetry**: Each story's acceptance criteria checklist is dynamically rendered in the Developer Dashboard (`markdown.html`), updating in real-time as stories are reviewed and approved.

## 🛑 STRICT PROHIBITION: No Direct AI Status Manipulation & Manager-Only Approval

- The AI agent is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** from using tools (`replace_file_content`, `write_to_file`, `run_command`, etc.) to change `status: In Review` -> `status: Approved` at ANY cost.
- ONLY THE MANAGER is authorized and permitted to change the status via Markdown Studio (`markdown.html`).
- The AI agent is **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** from prompting the developer to self-approve or change review statuses.
- The AI agent MUST ONLY instruct the developer to wait for the manager's review.
